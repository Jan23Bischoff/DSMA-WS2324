Destiny showed on her face that she wasn't happy to be there, but I ignored it and remained pleasant.  I was waiting for her to hand me the cup when I saw her dip it into ice.  I said to her that I wasn't aware that it was no longer self-service and that I didn't want ice.  I like to take it home and chill it in the frig.  Ice dilutes it.

When we called to ask what's going on - the manager said  We are really busy right now  and placed us on hold for FIFTEEN minutes, before we just hung up.

Unfortunately my sandwich had mold on it which is pretty disgusting. I wasted $11 on a giant sandwich is actually pretty expensive given the sandwich comes without cheese. Allowing the bread to sit out in the open air with no barrier to potential bacteria is a problem. When you go to publix the have the bread on a cart that is enclosed in a plastic barrier. When you go to subway, you see their bread encased in a warm oven like system. Jimmy Johns prices have skyrocketed. It appears their sandwiches exceed the price of publix now for a smaller sandwich if you include cheese. I've always been a fan of Jimmy Johns and the simplistic approach they have on sandwiches.

From telling them that I am allergic to tomatoes and finding tomatoes in my tacos 9 /10 times (I always have to check now before I pull away), to rude staff /employees.   Recently I stopped in for breakfast 2x. The first time I pulled up and had to read the menu. Breakfast is relatively new to Taco Bell, so I needed a minute to see what they had. There was nobody behind me in line. I was greeted at first, asked for a minute, and every 20 seconds she came back and asked if I was ready. By the 3rd time (about 60 seconds after I pulled up), she told me that they were on a timer so I had to be quick. Okay? I made my decision, paid *was not given a receipt*, and told to pull up and she would bring my food out. I kid you not when I say I waited 15 minutes and had to go back through the drive through to ask if my food was ready yet. The cashier did not say one word to me, closed the window, grabbed my food, and handed it to me. Didn't ask if I wanted any sauce or anything. I looked at her and said  You're not even going to say anything?  and she gave me a look of attitude. In customer service, especially fast food, if you make the person wait a crazy amount of time after scolding them for trying to read the menu, you at least say  sorry for the wait  or  thank you, come again . But nothing...  Despite my first poor experience with breakfast there, I did it again. This time, I knew what I wanted. I pulled up to the window to pay and it was that same rude girl from the last time. Once again no receipt. I pay and she tells me to pull forward and she will bring it out (there was nobody behind me), to which I politely responded that last time I did that, I waited 15 minutes and had to come back through the drive through and she just stared at me.  Okay  I said reluctantly. Well, this time I  only waited 7 minutes before having to go back through the drive through to ask where my food was. This time another woman came to the window, handed me my food, and didn't ask if I needed sauces. I said  may I please have fire sauce and a copy of my receipt?  to which she obliged, saying noting during this whole process.   The absolute worst customer service.

I waited...and waited.. Hello, can anyone hear me?  No response... Hello? Are you open? ...nothing. Literally minutes went by, and as I was about to pull away all of a sudden a voice came through the screen. I placed my order for myself and my gf , $14.26 was the total, and made my way towards the window. There was a young girl there and the first thing I asked her was whether or not she could hear me calling for her at the screen....she just looks at me and never responds.  How weird but whatever, I just got off work and I'm tired. She hands me a light bag and I asked her  is this everything?  And she says  umm I think it's half of it...  then walks away. I still haven't received my drinks and half the food is still missing. Just by the her demeanor I can tell she is not at all interested and I was convinced that this order wouldn't be correct. Anyway, I get the rest of the food. Instead of saying  have a nice day  she says  That's it.  And puts her focus on the computer screen expecting me to drive away. Keep in mind I am being very nice to her, but now I'm getting a little annoyed but im trying to hide it and not look irritated.  Excuse me ma'am but I haven't gotten the drinks yet , her response  Oh, what were they again?  Even thought its on my receipt and likely on her screen, I tell her again. She gets them, hands them to me with straws and walks away. Not even an I'm sorry, or have a nice day, no explanation just basically go away. Anyway  the order was surprisingly correct WHEW!. I went home to eat and immediately realize my Mexican pizza tortillas were completely stale after taking a bite and having that nasty taste in my mouth. Neither myself or my girlfriend would eat the food after that. If the girl at the window didn't care than why would any of the cooks if they are giving us nasty stale tortillas, I can only imagine how sanitary their kitchen is. So $14 down the drain because I'm too tired to drive back out there, but NEVER again!

I was appalled.   On another occasion, John dismissively and disrespectfully refused to make change for a man, who left angrily.   On another occasion, John incorrectly took my order. I'd ordered combination number eleven (11) and specified that two of the tacos should be one flavor (nacho cheese), and the third, another flavor (cool ranch). I was served six tacos and have to go back up front for a refund, whereupon the restaurant would not allow me to keep the extra tacos, but presumably threw them in the trash.  Today I come in and place the same order:  combination no. eleven (11). After five minutes, I notice that subsequent customers have received their food, and I go up front to inquire. I complain that this is the most poorly managed Taco Bell I've ever seen (I'm 43 y.o.). A woman assures me that my order will be out soon. About five minutes later, I come back up. John ignores me, but motions that it will be one minute. I ask him  what seems to be the problem?  He says that my order will be ready soon. I ask whether he thinks service like this is normal. He refuses to answer. I ask two more times, but he still refuses to answer. I say that whether food will be ready soon is not the point; I want to know why, and where it is. I tell him that I plan to complain to corporate this time. He says,  go ahead. I've got nothing to hide. My name is John. Tell Obama, too!  I ask whether he respects the President, but he ignores me, pretending to look at a drive-through screen. The manager, a woman, comes over, and I explain the situation to her. I ask whether she is aware that John is an idiot. She says that she'll talk to him privately, but I insist that she do so immediately, in front of me. I expect an apology (none was forthcoming). She refuses. She then asks me what I'd ordered. I ask her to look it up, presenting her my check card. She says that the registers are down, and so she cannot do that. She asks whether I want a cash refund. I say I want a refund back on the card, but she indicates that Taco Bell doesn't--or cannot--do that. I say that this is the most poorly managed Taco Bell I've ever seen. She says that she is sorry that I had a poor experience. I say that that is not an apology and is beside the point in any event:  it's not about me, it's about the restaurant's mismanagement and arrogance. She still refuses to apologize. She refuses to make John available to talk to me or answer my questions. She refers to him as  my employee.  She says that I am acting unruly. She says that if I don't leave, she will  kick you [me] out of my [her] Taco Bell.  (She hadn't paid me any cash refund yet. I did not swear during the entire incident or threaten physical violence. I had a legitimate business purpose to be there, as I've eaten at this location several times and was awaiting a refund.) I ask whether she owns the restaurant or acts as a franchisee. Another employee chimes in that she does own the restaurant. I tell her that I don't believe her. I indicate that if John does not answer my questions regarding the normalcy of this service or whether he respects the President, I will never return to this Taco Bell location again. The manager says  good.  I further indicate that my parents, whom I'm visiting in Tucson, warned me not to visit this specific Taco Bell location. She says that she is sorry that I don't like this restaurant or the neighborhood. I indicate that part of the problem is that she's ignorant and uneducated, and thus arrogant and unresponsive to customer complaints. When she pays me my cash refund, she waits approximately five seconds and presents her phone. She says that she is dialing the police. Not wanting to make a further scene, I depart, whereupon I hear cheers--presumably from staff--behind me as I leave. Yes, I could have awaited the police, but why?

Tonight, I was planning to hang out with friends I don't see very often and one person in the family is challenged by a food allergy list that leaves me exhausted even reading it. This happens to be one of the restaurants where she's able to go, she knows what she can eat, and she seems to be able to enjoy herself at the same time.   So, it was the perfect chance to try Panda Express.   For those not in the know, Panda Express is the largest chain of what they call  Chinese American Cuisine  restaurants in the United States. They are what is considered  fast casual,  a growing concept in the food industry for the person seeking a generally higher quality of food than 'fast food,  but still not requiring table service. In this case, you order up at a counter and work from a basic concept of a meal that serves up two entrees and one side. With a drink, you can eat for right around $10.00. While I've read some reviews indicating the food freshness can vary, I can say on my visit that the food was fresh. The  sides  range from your usual varied types of rice to noodles, etc. Then, you go for two entrees out of a variety of choices in the general categories of beef, chicken, seafood, and regional entrees. They also have appetizers and, of course, fortune cookies.   I ordered fried rice as my side along with two chicken entrees, orange chicken and a special teriyaki mixture that was labeled as new on the menu. They had your usual soft drink options along with a couple of iced tea options, water, Sobe, and Izze beverages. I took an iced tea option.   While the restaurant isn't what I'd call wheelchair friendly, most of their tables and chairs are fairly light and it's simple to move them around. The front entrance had a curb cut that made for easy access, while the restaurant offered a single table (that looked rather dirty in my opinion) for outside dining.   The staff was friendly and patient with me as I surveyed the menu since this was my first visit. While they didn't explain anything, I will say that most of it is fairly obvious as to how things work there.   The food? I described it to one of my friends as fairly average Americanized Chinese. It was neither outstanding or disappointing. It was a good meal at a fair price. The rice wasn't necessarily  fresh,  but it also didn't taste like it had been sitting around. It was good and definitely surpassed some of my usual Chinese restaurants. The two chicken choices I made were appealing, though I definitely preferred the absolutely delicious teriyaki option. I liked that we could sit there and enjoy our meal without feeling pressured to leave. That's rare these days and I appreciated the hospitality.   If I were rating it, I think, on my usual standards I'd likely stick with a three-star rating. However, I think it deserves an extra star because the diversity of their menu allows someone with serious allergies to have a tasty, quality meal and that's rare in this day and age when it seems like every restaurant cuts corners and serves up tons of artificial garbage. I also really appreciated the hospitality and the friendliness of the staff on this visit. So, in my estimation that deserves another star.   So, while you may not necessarily get the authentic Chinese experience at Panda Express, you will get a fairly priced and good tasting meal and there are options for folks with dietary restrictions. I won't likely make the restaurant a destination experience, but when I'm in the neighborhood I'll definitely visit.",2,0,0,NEGATIVE,0.0006668753339909017,0.30030393600463867,0.9755136966705322,0.40603941679000854

Looking at all the 5 star reviews here, I'd say you are safe to skip over the 1 and 2 star ratings.  There is no  ick , just eat here quick!  I was part of the  Belly  rewards program in 2013, which has now been replaced by the Chick Fil A  A list .  The Belly program, if you are not familiar with it, gives you points each time you visit a Belly participating store which you can redeem for merchandise.  I went over 100 times in 2013.  Kinda scary to think of...and what did I get from it?  A Chick Fil A party for 10 guests which included a visit from the Cow!  It was a lot of fun and Danny, a manager here, really hooked us up!  I will admit I was a bit ashamed when I saw exactly how many times I ate fast food, but at least it was all at Chick Fil A, which is a shining star in the dark night of McDees and the King...  IMHO, this is the fast food restaurant that every other fast food restaurant should be modeling themselves from.  The location is well kept, well lit, clean, and staffed and run by a great team.  This place PACKS during lunch hours but the staff is amazing and really keeps things moving.  As I said before, they even send staff into the drive thru lane to take orders from folks in line.  They really do things right here!  Great management and staff at this location.  Fantastic employees, they do a good job hiring these folks.  My only complaint is that they say  my pleasure  just too much for it to really be their pleasure!   These folks are enthusiastic, even tho many of them are very young, management does a great job vetting these folks out and getting them started in the workforce.  Employees make rounds clearing trays and offering to get refills for drinks.  They embrace the local community with regular events for families, open mic night, and always seem to have something coming up on their community calendar.  Food.  It's Chic-Fil-A...It's delicious!

The tables, chairs, and floors were very dirty and It was also the first thing I noticed when I walked in. I am scared to know what the bathrooms looked like. I will also add that while We were eating, an employee began moping RIGHT BESIDE our table. So close that she hit me in the head with the end of the mop by mistake. It was funny and amusing. I laughed, and she apologized but she shouldn't have been moping so close to our table. I don't know what she was mopping anyway because it didn't make any difference of the dirty floor. #4) There were no napkins, or napkin dispenser.

There are also salads that are real salads to choose from, with chicken or Mediterranean.  I gave it a try on the advice of the recent five-star reviews. My experience today was disappointing, however.  The server at the drive-thru speaker didn't know the menu, such as what the drinks consist of (did the new limeade have sugar, etc. Even the drink that is an old standby of mine when I've went in years past, the green tea, is billed as  natural,  yet I am informed today that there is sweetener. That could be anything, and important, especially to a dieter, a diabetic or someone who can't use additives. Rather deceptive of Wendy's industry /menu, not this particular Wendy's as a whole, as most people aren't going to fast food for their health and I suspect that they don't get asked this question or perhaps she was new.  I got a single with cheese for my husband. Too expensive for what he received.  My salad, a new one with avocado, they got partially right and I didn't know until I was driving into the next town and almost home. So I paid for toppings I didn't get. The item I want got left off but so did a lot of the other salad items. No nuts, no crackers, noodles, nothing on the side for an expensive salad, but romaine, chicken which tasted okay, and a bit of cheese. I'll have to look up and make sure romaine isn't still on recall.   The reason for two stars, which I rarely give anyone low rating unless it's obviously outrageous service? Lip piercing on the server and dirty fingernails on another gal.

The drive through had a super long line so my tip is to park in the large parking lot and go for counter service as it was much quicker. Always go for the chicken fingers and the chicken sandwich as those are the musts and tastes great. Unlimited sauces to choose from and you can get as many packets as you want. Kudos to the chick fil a sauce and the honey mustard.,6,1,3,POSITIVE,0.5412148833274841,0.8386396765708923,0.9673495292663574,0.8569725155830383

Food: Chipotle serves huge portions and typically doesn't hold back on the toppings. Treat them nicely and they'll definitely make you a worthy meal. I usually prefer the chicken or sofritas salads as healthier options (and skip the cheese, sour cream and guacamole--using salsa as my dressing), while my husband usually goes big with a giant steak /chicken combo burrito.   Drinks: Self-serve soda and refrigerated case of other beverages.  Atmosphere: The Eagle location is the lightest and brightest, with a separate room that tends to be a bit quieter during the busy times. Great and quiet outdoor seating as well.   Service: The staff is generally nice.   Healthy Hack: Go basic with a sofritas or chicken salad with black beans, fajita veggies and salsa. Plenty of flavor, low on cals.  Tips: Ask for sour cream and salsa on the side if you don't want a drenched burrito. Try salsa for salad dressing instead of the vinaigrette.",1,0,1,POSITIVE,0.134645476937294,0.9244853258132935,0.8689004778862,0.9662237167358398
